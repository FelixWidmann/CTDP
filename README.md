# Continuous-Time Derivatives Pricing â€” Final Project (University of TÃ¼bingen)

This repository contains the final **poster** and **code** for the course *Continuous-Time Derivatives Pricing* at the **University of TÃ¼bingen**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

We design and evaluate a structured productâ€”an **Express Certificate on Microsoft (MSFT)**â€”including:

* **Product Design:** payoff logic, early redemption (autocall) features, and barrier conditions.
* **Pricing & Greeks:** **binomial tree** valuation with computation of **Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta,** and **Rho**.
* **Performance & Stress Testing:** historical-style and hypothetical scenarios; sensitivity to key risk drivers (spot, vol, rates, dividends).

> **Note:** This repository is intended for academic purposes. Results depend on the chosen modeling assumptions and input data.

## ðŸ“ˆ Outputs

* **Price & Greeks tables** per valuation date and parameter set.
* **Charts:** price sensitivity, Greeks profiles, and scenario outcome distributions.
* **Poster:** `poster/final_poster.pdf` summarizes design, method, and results.
